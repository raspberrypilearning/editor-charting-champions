The chart looks good, but nearly 150 nations have competed in the Olympics. Instead of typing them all, you will load the data from a file. This saves a lot of time.

### CSV files
CSV stands for **C**omma-**S**eparated **V**alue.

There are several `.csv` files included in this starter project that contain the data you need for your charts.

Click on the file icon and click on `medals.csv`. See how each line has a team name and the number of medals they have won, separated by a comma.
