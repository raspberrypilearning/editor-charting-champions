Load bigger datasets from a CSV file

The chart looks good, but nearly 150 nations have competed in the Olympics. Instead of typing them all, you will load the data from a file. This saves a lot of time.

### CSV files**
CSV stands for **C**omma-**S**eparated **V**alue. CSV files contain data in rows and columns, like a table. Each line is a row, with commas separating that row's values into columns.

There are several `.csv` files included in this starter project that contain the data you need for your charts.

Click on the file icon and open `medals.csv`. See how each line has a team name and the number of medals they have won, separated by a comma.
